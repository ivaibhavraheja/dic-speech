              We are DIC-UIET, an interdisciplinary Research Lab based in San Francisco. We investigate novel concepts that underlie the complexities of our field. Our research is supported by funding from the government and a number of foundations. Several ideas are being pursued for developing a new pedagogy in teaching and training in design, new fabrications, and innovations. A number of design technologies for smart cities, biomedical devices, advanced materials, navigational and tourism aids, green environment, energy & traffic management, communication, etc have been taken up at the DIC in PU.
